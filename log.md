# Log of a power of 10 tells you how many 0s there are after the 1:
- log 1 = 0
- log 10 = 1
- log 100 = 2
- log 1000 = 3

 log (x y) = log x + log y
# When you multiply powers of 10, the number of zeros get added.
# For example, 10x100 = 1000. So, log 10 + log 100 = log 1000, 1+2=3.

# Log of the reciprocal of a power of 10 is negative,
# -1 times the log of the denominator.
#
# log 1/10 = -1
# log 1/100 = -2
# log 1/1000 = -3
#
# The second property still works.
# log 1/10 + log 100 = log 100/10 = log 10. -1+2 = 1.


log_x y = The number of times you can repeatedly divide a group of y Skittles into groups of x Skittles.

If log x = y, then 10^y = x.

The other direction is that log 10^x = x.
log 10^3 = log 1000 = 3
